#### STEP 1: Loading necessary libraries...

* In this step the script load the library "dplyr", useful for managing dataframes. 


####  STEP 2: Checking necessary files... 
* In this step the script check for necessary files, always in **current working directory**.

* Check if folder "UCI HAR Dataset" exists. TRAIN and TEST subfolder must be in this folder.

* Check if "activity_labels.txt" file exists.
    + This file contains the labels for each activity. 
    
* Check if "features.txt" file exists.
    + This file contains the labels for each feature (every measurement type).   
    
* Check if TEST files exist.
    + "subject_test.txt": This file contains an identifier (integer ID) for each person who performed measurements.
    + "X_test.txt": This file contains every testing measurement.
    + "y_test.txt": This file contains the activity ID that each person was doing when testing measurements were taken.    
    
* Check if TRAIN files exist.
    + "subject_train.txt": This file contains an identifier (integer ID) for each person who performed measurements.
    + "X_train.txt": This file contains every training measurement.
    + "y_train.txt": This file contains the activity ID that each person was doing when training measurements were taken.
    
         
####  STEP 3: Reading the TEST files...
* If testing files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df".

```
test_subject_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
test_X_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
test_y_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
```

####  STEP 4: Reading the TRAIN files...
* If training files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df".

```
train_subject_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))
train_X_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))
train_y_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))

```
                                                        
####  STEP 5: Reading the ACTIVITY and FEATURES files...
* If activity and features files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df". In this case, we set the "stringsAsFactors" option to FALSE, and so, our variable names will be "characters" and not "factors".

```
activity_names <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = TRUE))        
feature_names <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = TRUE))

```
         
####  STEP 6: Merging the TEST and TRAIN data tables....
* Now, we merge train datasets and test datasets separately.
* In this way:
   + we bind all train and test features datasets.
   + we bind all train and test activity ID's datasets.   
   + we bind all train and test subject datasets.

```
X_merged <- rbind(test_X_df, train_X_df)
y_merged <- rbind(test_y_df, train_y_df)
subject_merged <- rbind(test_subject_df, train_subject_df)
```

        
####  STEP 7: Getting the FEATURE NAMES...
* In this step we extract a character vector with the names of each feature, subsetting the "feature_names" dataframe.

```
name_of_features <- feature_names$V2  
```
* There are problems with duplicate names in 'name_of_features', so, we need check the names and rewrite them in a unique form. The result is stored in the same variable 'name_of_features'

```
name_of_features <- make.names(name_of_features, unique = TRUE)  
```

    
####  STEP 8: Setting the FEATURE NAMES...
* Assign the "name_of_features" to the features dataframe (X_merged) as variable names or column names.
```
names(X_merged) <- name_of_features  
```
    
####  STEP 9: Joining the ACTIVITY NAMES and ACTIVITY table...
* In this step, the script joins the "activity_names" dataframe and "y_merged"" dataframe by the column V1. This way, we get a dataframe with all the activity names.

```
activity_df <- left_join(y_merged, activity_names, by = "V1") 
```
* The previous dataframe "activity_df" has two columns, V1 = an index, and V2 = the full list of activities. The second one, is the column we need, so the script subsets "activity_df" and store the result in the same dataframe.

```
activity_df <- select(activity_df, V2)
```

    
####  STEP 10: Binding Subject, Activity and Measurements tables...
* Putting all together. In this step, the script binds all dataframes we need together, subject dataframe (subject_merged), activity dataframe (activity_df) and features dataframe (X_merged). The result is stored in "data_table"

```
data_table <- tbl_df(cbind(subject_merged, activity_df, X_merged))
```

####  STEP 11: Getting the data table with Subject, Activity, MEAN and STD values...
* In this step, the script get the INDEX of COLUMNS with MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION values from the character vector "name_of_features". 

```
 mean_std_columns_index <- grep("mean|std", name_of_features, value = FALSE) 
```

This index gives us the position of MEAN and STD columns in the "data_table" dataset. Previously, we need to ADD the NUMBER "2" to this columns index, because in the final "data_table" dataset, the First and Second columns are the SUBJECT and the ACTIVITY values, so we need to "JUMP" this 2 first columns.

```
  mean_std_columns_index <- mean_std_columns_index + 2  
```
* Get the table with the SUBJECT (V1), ACTIVITY (V2) and MEAN and STD values (using tne index "mean_std_columns_index")        

```
mean_std_data_table <- select(data_table, V1, V2, mean_std_columns_index)  
```

* Rename the subject column (V1) and Activity column (V2) with descriptive names

```
mean_std_data_table <- rename(mean_std_data_table, Subject = V1, Activity = V2)
```  


####  STEP 12: Getting the final tidy dataset with the average of all measurement values (mean and std), grouped by Subject and Activity...

* First, the script groups the "mean_std_data_table" dataset by SUBJECT and ACTIVITY

```
 my_group <- group_by(mean_std_data_table,Subject,Activity) 
```
* Then, the script summarize the dataframe grouped "my_group", and gets the "final_tydy_dataset", applying the mean function to the measurement columns.

```
 final_tidy_dataset <- summarise_each(my_group, funs(mean))
```

#### FINAL STEP: Writting the result file in the current working directory...
* The result is stored in the "final_tidy_dataset.txt" file.

```
write.table(final_tidy_dataset, file = "final_tidy_dataset.txt", row.names = FALSE)
```
* You can read this file with the following code:

```
x <- read.table("final_tidy_dataset.txt", header = TRUE)
```
