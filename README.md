### STEP 1: Loading necessary libraries...

* In this step the script load the library "dplyr", useful for managing dataframes. 

###  STEP 2: Checking necessary files... 
 * In this step the script check for necessary files.
 * Check if folder "UCI HAR Dataset" exists.
 * Check if "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt" file exist. 
        * In this file we get the activity labels
