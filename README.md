           Done!
           
#### STEP 1: Loading necessary libraries...

* In this step the script load the library "dplyr", useful for managing dataframes. 


####  STEP 2: Checking necessary files... 
* In this step the script check for necessary files, always in **current working directory**.

* Check if folder "UCI HAR Dataset" exists. TRAIN and TEST subfolder must be in this folder.

* Check if "activity_labels.txt" file exists.
    + This file contains the labels for each activity. 
    
* Check if "features.txt" file exists.
    + This file contains the labels for each feature (every measurement type).   
    
* Check if TEST files exist.
    + "subject_test.txt": This file contains an identifier (integer ID) for each person who performed measurements.
    + "X_test.txt": This file contains every testing measurement.
    + "y_test.txt": This file contains the activity ID that each person was doing when testing measurements were taken.    
    
* Check if TRAIN files exist.
    + "subject_train.txt": This file contains an identifier (integer ID) for each person who performed measurements.
    + "X_train.txt": This file contains every training measurement.
    + "y_train.txt": This file contains the activity ID that each person was doing when training measurements were taken.
    
         
####  STEP 3: Reading the TEST files...
* If testing files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df".

```
test_subject_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
test_X_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
test_y_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", check.names = TRUE))
```

####  STEP 4: Reading the TRAIN files...
* If training files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df".

```
train_subject_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))
train_X_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))
train_y_df <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", check.names = TRUE))

```
                                                        
####  STEP 5: Reading the ACTIVITY and FEATURES files...
* If activity and features files exist, it's time to read them.
* In a general way, the files are read with "read.table" function with "check.names" option set to TRUE, to avoid possible duplicate variable names, and convert into a "dplyr" table dataframe with the function "tpl_df".

```
activity_names <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = TRUE))        
feature_names <- tbl_df(read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = TRUE))

```
         
####  STEP 6: Merging the TEST and TRAIN data tables....")
* Now, we merge train datasets and test datasets separately.
* In this way:
   + we bind all train and test features datasets.
   + we bind all train and test activity ID's datasets.   
   + we bind all train and test subject datasets.

```
X_merged <- rbind(test_X_df, train_X_df)
y_merged <- rbind(test_y_df, train_y_df)
subject_merged <- rbind(test_subject_df, train_subject_df)

```
